In the spirit of Tailwind reducing the amount of code you write for tens of millions, I'll aim to keep this short and sweet as well.

## So... who in the world is this Sam guy?

Greetings Adam, Steve, Robin, and the rest of the Tailwind team! I'm [Sam](https://www.saminamanat.com), a software engineer from the Bay Area. I've been designing for the web for nearly a decade, looking for the next step on my journey. The biggest understatement I could make would be calling myself a fan of Tailwind's work.
Knowing that there are a tremendous set of very talented folks eager to join your mission, worst case scenario lets at least grab a coffee sometime if you're ever nearby!

## Nice to meet you Sam! What do you think of Tailwind?

When the pandemic hit and all our favorite gyms closed up, I had the *totally* original idea to get into biking. At one point I got pretty stuck between two choices, and asked a friend for some advice since she's sold and fixed bikes for over a decade.
My two choices were the same bike, but one was more expensive yet was painted in a color that just spoke to me. She said: *"The best bike is the one you actually ride. If you look at your bike in the morning, and it makes you want to go out and ride, then that's the one you should get. Even if you have the nicest bike money could buy, if you thought it was ugly, you'd forget about it in a week."*

The sentiment stuck with me, and could not be more true. Humans love things that are beautiful, it's as simple as that. Tailwind does not just make things easy, or consistent, it doesn't just reduce your CSS down to a third, or even grind the gears of Twitter trolls, it physically makes me want to plug in my keyboard, and build, build, build.

I remember watching the [Tailwind Connect 2023 Keynote](https://youtu.be/CLkxRnRQtDE) and out loud saying "Yes! Exactly!" to my phone more times than I could count. Throughout my years of teaching computer science,
I've always passionatly pushed my students towards the utility-first approach and yet was never able to put it into words as well as Adam did. The idea of building a toolkit to work as a catalyst for creativity genuinely 
reminded me of the early days of the web, where we were all just figuring things out as we went along.

## Okay that's cool and all, but what about the job?

Oh, right! Well, as I was playing around with Catalyst in early January, sadly, it seemed to be missing quite a few components! Likewise, TailwindUI has many fantastic components, however some lack dark theme support, consistency between pages, or even the modularity that Catalyst has spoiled me with. I decided why not build it myself, and so I did! I joked with my friends at the time, *"Man, if only they were hiring, I would love to help them just get this done. Maybe I should get a Tailwind tattoo to stand out..."*. Low and behold, a few months later, here we are!

## What do you think you could bring to the team?

I have a passion for teaching, and an even stronger one to learn. One thing I'm grateful for from my time working with kids, is how creative they can get when solving problems. Even when throwing a classic like FizzBuzz or TwoSum at a third grader, I would never fail to be surprised by their approach. I have a deep belief that everyone, regardless of experience, is worth learning from.

1. Another set of human eyes. When I volunteered as an honorary judge for Viking Hacks, my task was to walk around and help students debug their projects. My superpower is taking one look, and going "yep, here's your issue my friend".
2. The ability to explain clearly and effectively. The old saying goes "If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself."
3. A computer science background that extends beyond the scope of web development. In college I graduated with a degree in computer science, coupled with an advanced C++ certification. Although I currently call the land of JavaScript my home, I'm no stranger to traditional languages and paradigms.
4. I've worked in, played in, and taught in, Python, C#, D3.js, C++, Go, and a teeeeny bit of Java (I'm sorry). Funny enough, the one language I haven't gotten to yet is Rust, but I'm confident that with your team, getting up to speed would just be a fun weekend!
5. Great taste in music.

## Alright Sam, you've got our attention. What's next?

I know I promised to keep things simple, so if you read this far, feel free to [request access to my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zOdYBn-na3qvpF1o7gS9gmBLWk8epZ20/view?usp=sharing) and check out [my projects](https://www.saminamanat.com/projects)! Thank you for taking a look, and I hope to hear from you soon!

P.S. I'm still considering that tattoo...
