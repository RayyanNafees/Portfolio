Picture this: a seemingly ordinary activity that most of us take for granted — typing. We do it every day, effortlessly tapping away at keyboards and touchscreens. But what if I told you that there’s a hidden world within the realm of typing? A world where words turn into art, speed becomes a skill, and a community of typing enthusiasts thrives in obscurity. Join me on a journey into the rabbit hole of keyboards, where keystrokes unlock an entire universe of dedicated typists, and typing becomes an unexpected passion you never knew existed.

Ah, high school days, where my fidgeting antics took on a life of their own. You see, my ADHD had a way of making my attention wander like a stray cat. So, to keep my restless fingers in check, I resorted to a little trickery. While my classmates and professors thought I was the epitome of focus, diligently taking notes on my laptop, little did they know the truth. Behind that facade, I was knee-deep in a world of typing tests on the most bizarre websites I could find. It was my secret obsession, my personal escape from the monotony of the classroom. The intensity with which I attacked those virtual keyboards was something to behold, like a typewriter possessed. I was like a ninja, fighting battles with words, my fingers dancing across the keys as if they had a mind of their own. It was a hidden thrill, a clandestine affair with the clickety-clack of keys that kept me on the edge of my seat. And boy, did those keyboards take a beating!

You won’t believe how my innocent little hobby of typing tests during class turned into a full-blown obsession. Picture me, sitting there, secretly typing away while everyone else thought I was diligently taking notes. It was like a hidden addiction that I couldn’t resist. But then, something amazing happened. I realized, “Hey, I’m not half bad at this!” I was hovering in the high 80s or mid-90s, just a hair away from that elusive 100 words per minute mark. That’s when it hit me. Maybe, just maybe, I could actually get really good at this whole typing thing.

Now, here’s the kicker. I’m a software engineer, and keyboards are practically an extension of my existence. I code, I communicate, and I spend more time with these keys than with most people. So, imagine the light bulb moment when I realized that improving my typing skills could genuinely level up my game in this keyboard-dominated world. It was like discovering a secret weapon right at my fingertips.

In my free time, I find solace in playing the piano. I mean, it’s no surprise that my fingers were destined for greatness, right? Whether I’m typing lines of code or crafting melodies, these versatile digits yearn for mastery. So, I decided to embark on a quest — a quest to train these fingers, to refine their dexterity and agility. It’s not just about typing; it’s a symphony of skills, a harmonious blend of technical prowess and musical finesse.

So, here’s the deal — I kept pushing myself, determined to get better and better, but then I hit a plateau around the 120 words per minute mark. Man, talk about frustrating! I thought that was it, the end of the road for my typing journey. But hold up, because destiny had something else in mind. Enter [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/), the absolute best site I’ve ever come across. I’m talking mind-blowing customization options, themes that make typing feel like a wild adventure, and a diverse range of typing tests with exciting variations. But that’s not even the best part! With Monkeytype, I could train on my commonly mistyped words, go head-to-head in friendly competitions against other typists, and so much more. It was like the missing piece of the puzzle, the next step on my quest from good to great. Monkeytype became my secret weapon, propelling me forward and unlocking levels of typing mastery I never thought possible.

Even my coworkers, curiously glancing over from time to time, now embrace Monkeytype themselves for both fun and self-improvement. My discovery of the typing world opened the door to an incredible online community of typing enthusiasts, a network of like-minded individuals who shared my love for the art of typing. This vibrant community became a source of inspiration, camaraderie, and friendly competition.

The quest for speed, accuracy, and mastery has ignited a fire within, driving me to continually push the boundaries of my typing abilities.

That’s where things get mind-boggling. While my achievements may be impressive to me, they don’t hold a candle to the typing gods among us. Take [Rocket](https://www.youtube.com/@mythicalrocket), for example, a 15-year-old prodigy who has shattered records that seem straight out of fiction. Can you believe he typed close to [230 words per minute for an entire hour straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGvEE4dE5Og)? And that’s not all. In burst tests, he’s broken the inconceivable [400 wpm barrier](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OxuTojtY8Wc)! Rocket’s skills are truly unstoppable, leaving us mere mortals in awe.

Regardless of how insanely talented others may be, nobody should ever feel discouraged. In today’s fast-paced world, where keyboards dominate our daily lives, it’s always worth taking a few minutes here and there to practice. Whether you’re aiming for lightning-fast speed, improved accuracy, or simply to feel more confident with your typing, the time invested in honing this skill is never wasted.

As I continue on this captivating journey, I hope to share the joy of typing with others and inspire them to uncover the hidden world that lies beneath their fingertips. Together, let’s embrace the rhythmic art of typing, one keystroke at a time.
